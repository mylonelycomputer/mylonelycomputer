# Hello, Navi

![Colourful computer terminal with the text "Hello Navi" on screen](hello_navi.png)

I am a media and software artist and digital accessibility specialist. I work with identity, memory, and nostalgia, waxing hypermedia poetics to access alternative networks of care for more just futures.

I am currently studying for the [IAAP Web Accessibility Specialist (WAS) Certification](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/wascertification) and documenting as I go in [a11y-study](https://github.com/mylonelycomputer/a11y-study).

My personal website is [guerrero.ph](https://guerrero.ph) and you may reach me via email at el@guerrero.ph.
